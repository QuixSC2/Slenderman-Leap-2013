The project files have been set up to accomodate those who want to jump into the project that is already completed and those who want to create
their own project using the assets we created. 

For those who want to use the project that is already complete:
1. Create a new project
2. Load the Project File [File>Open Project>Open Other>....]
3. Open the Scenes folder in Unity and double click the lesson you would like to begin.

For those who would like to create their own project using the assets we created:
1. Create a new project
2. Import the assets from the Raw Assets folder as needed through out the course.



NOTE: FBX files have been provided to ensure meshes can be imported without a specific 3d package.


Lesson 2 and 3 do not have corresponding scene files because in these lessons we only set up our project files and materials. 
So to avoid confusion, we left them out.
